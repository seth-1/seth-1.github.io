# Introduction

We will use antismash outputs of 4 Aspergillus genomes to mine them for secondary metabolic gene clusters. Using R we will develop a high throughput method which helps us to compare multiple datasets containing large amounts of data and mining for natural products of interest.

## Input

* Load the file sm_annotation.tsv into R
* Inspect your data, what are the variables?

## Overview

Create an overview of the secondary metabolism for all organisms.

* Choose an appropriate visualization for your data
* Why did you choose a certain geom for your plot?
* What does the plot tell you about secondary metabolism in the 4 species
